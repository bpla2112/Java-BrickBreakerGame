# Java-BrickBreakerGame
A Brick Breaker game in Java.

**How it Works**
- This runs in Java 1.8
- You would need to load the project into your IDE and run it. Some refactoring may be required. 
- When the game has loaded,  the **Enter** key will start the game. 
- Use the left and right arrows to hit the ball with the paddle and collect the powerups to increase your brick breaking rate. 

**What's next?**
- Create an installer
- Add more powerups
- Possibility for multiple levels and design arrangements of the bricks. 

**Have Fun**
